Passionate about cybersecurity, I’m currently mastering full-stack penetration testing across web, systems, APIs, Wi-Fi, mobile, IoT, and cloud domains. I’ve completed the TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester path and am working toward certifications like PNPT and eJPTv2.

I’ve built solo projects like a Mobile Penetration Testing Toolkit using Python and a Dark Web–CDR Analysis Tool for call detail investigation and OSINT correlation. My learning is backed by real CTF practice (TryHackMe, Hack The Box, VulnHub) and daily lab work.

My goal is to contribute to red team engagements and eventually lead security research initiatives in offensive security. I'm open to internships, freelance projects, and red team mentorship opportunities.

Let’s connect if you’re looking for someone who’s hands-on, self-driven, and genuinely obsessed with hacking the right way.
